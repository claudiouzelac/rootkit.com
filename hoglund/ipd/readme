Name   : Integrity Protection Driver (IPD)
Version: 1.0 - First Release
Purpose: Prevent installation of rootkit device drivers on NT/2000
License: Open Source

Integrity Protection Driver (IPD)
---------------------------------

The IPD is an Open Source device driver designed to prohibit the
installation of new services and drivers and to protect existing drivers
from tampering. It installs on Windows NT or Windows 2000 computers.

Updated information about this driver may be found at

      http://www.pedestalsoftware.com/


Motivation
----------

This driver was created to provide some protection against rootkit
installation by attempting to block any new kernel drivers from being
installed and executed. This will help to prevent tojan hiding from
integrity checking programs such as Intact.


What It Does
------------

The IPD uses undocumented service function hooking to alter the access
mask on driver-related registry keys and files to be read-only no matter
what account is requesting access. This effectively prohibits the
Service Control Manager or user applications from changing, adding or
deleting service and driver keys and values in the registry and from
adding to or replacing existing driver binaries in the
%SystemRoot%\system32\drivers directory.


Is there a way to circumvent the IPD?
-------------------------------------

If there is a mechanism to load and execute a device driver without
using Service Control Manager functions and without the need to write
to the Services portion of the registry, then there may be a way to
circumvent the IPD. We are not aware of any such machanism to do
this. However, if one is discovered the IPD could be ammended to hook
and alter the functions used.


What's Included
---------------

You should have received the following files with your distribution:

  ipd.sys         -- the compiled device driver for i386 computers
  ipdinstall.exe  -- the installation/remove program
  readme          -- this file
  driver/*        -- source files


Installation
------------

To install the IPD device driver, unzip all files into a directory. 
Execute the ipdinstall.exe program to install and start the driver:

	ipdinstall.exe install

The driver is installed for "automatic" startup, which means it will
automatically start at system boot. The driver engages, or begins
protecting, 20 minutes after it has started.


IMPORTANT:

* Once the Driver is started it may not be stopped.

* Once the Driver is engaged it may not be removed. Even if the
appropriate Service Control Manager function call marks the driver for
deletion, the driver will still not be removed. 


Removal
-------

YOU MUST REMOVE THE IPD DEVICE DRIVER WITHIN 20 MINUTES OF STARTUP,
AND THEN REBOOT THE SYSTEM. If the driver has already engaged then you
will have to reboot and remove it within 20 mintes of boot up.

The remove command is:

	ipdinstall.exe remove
