Version 1.4
-----------
Removed the hooks to ZwOpenFile and ZwCreateFile which used to protect
the %SystemRoot%\system32\drivers directory. The driver now locates
then opens and locks each driver file individually. Driver files are
located by scanning the Services section of the registry and they are
subsequently opened with shared read access using ZwOpenFile.

Version 1.3
-----------
Added block of ZwCreateSymbolicLinkObject to block the creation of an
alias name for \Device\PhysicalMemory (see Phrack 59-16,
http://www.phrack.org/show.php?p=59&a=16 by crazylord
<crazylord@minithins.net>).

Patched util.c to fix the Time Vulnerability as posted on NTBUGTRAQ by
Jan K. Rutkowski <jkrutkowski@elka.pw.edu.pl>.

Version 1.2
-----------
Added block of ZwSetSystemInformation()'s SystemLoadAndCallImage.

Added the Oracle listener service to the list of images that are
allowed privileges. The listener is using PROCESS_CREATE_THREAD
and PROCESS_VM_WRITE when opening another oracle service process.
