:[10/05/05]: Version 1.0.1

kld.h, kdl.c - Removed the registry structure and used a single variable gRegistryPath.

Added kdlx86.inf as another entry point for installation. Right click on the file and chose install.

Added (kdl.h)LARGE_INTEGER theEOF; to _DEVICE_EXTENSION so we can append key data to the end of the logfile. Also modified (kdlfile.c/CreateLogFile)ZwCreateFile() DesiredAccess to SYNCHRONIZE | FILE_WRITE_DATA | FILE_WRITE_ATTRIBUTES | FILE_WRITE_EA. And (kdlfile.c/WriteDataFile)ZwWriteFile() ByteOffset &theDeviceExtension->theEOF. This appears to have solved the problem with key data being appended to the log file.


:[10/09/05]: Version 1.0.2

- Cleaning up the code a bit as I learn more about device drivers

Added (kdl.h)ExFreePoolWithTag( a, b ) ExFreePool( (a) ) MACRO for cleaner win2k compatability.
Changed (kdl.c)"for ( i=0; i < IRP_MJ_MAXIMUM_FUNCTION; i++ )" into " for ( i=0; i <= IRP_MJ_MAXIMUM_FUNCTION; i++ )".
Added (kdl.h)#defien tags for ExAllocatePoolWithTag() functions.
Changed (kdlx86.inf) "StartType = 3" into "StartType = 0" to prompt for a restart after installation.

:[10/11/05]: Version 1.0.3

Changed install.bat into loaderinstall.bat and uninstall.bat into loaderunistall.bat. Name change only.
Created infinstall.cmd and infuninstall.cmd as alternates to using the kdl.exe loader
 New file infinstall.cmd as an alternate to right clicking and choosing install from the kdlx86.inf file.
 New file infuninstall.cmd as an alternate to using kdl.exe loader to uninstall the driver.
