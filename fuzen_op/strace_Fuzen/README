This is a system call tracer for Windows NT/2000/XP. It is composed of two parts: 
a user level program called strace.exe and a device driver called strace.sys. It
prints messages of the form:

taskmgr.exe:1148 just called Syscall: NtOpenProcess
taskmgr.exe:1148 just called Syscall: NtClose
taskmgr.exe:1148 just called Syscall: NtQuerySystemInformation
taskmgr.exe:1148 just called Syscall: NtQuerySystemInformation
taskmgr.exe:1148 just called Syscall: NtWaitForSingleObject
taskmgr.exe:1148 just called Syscall: NtSetEvent

Program Usage:
	strace <PID> <Upper Limit>

	Where PID is the process ID of the program you want to monitor and Upper Limit
	is the upper limit on the system calls you want to see. I did this so you can 
	filter out system calls related to the GUI. For instance, on Windows 2000
	Advanced Server there are 0xf8 system calls exported from ntoskrnl.exe that
	are the meat of the OS, and system calls from 1000 (decimal) and up are GUI
	related system calls.

I have dynamically obtained the names of the ntoskrnl.exe functions that begin with Zw.
If I do not know the name, as is the case with the GUI functions, strace will just print
the system call number. You will have to figure it out from there.


TODO:
	Add detailed support for function arguments. For instance, what process did 
	NtCreateProcess just create? Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Caveat:
	I have only compiled this for Windows 2000 Advanced Server, but the code is written 
	generic enough that you should be able to recompile on NT or XP.

	Also, the binaries I have included will only run on Windows 2000/XP. See above. You
	will definitely have to recompile for NT because the kernel in 2000/XP exports 
	except_handler3 and NT does not so the driver is not compatible across all three.

	It appears that the interrupts are different or handled differently on XP. strace.sys 
	hooks interrupt 0x2e in the IDT. I have not been able to determine if anything actually 
	passes through the IDT at this point. I still need to load the symbols for XP to debug 
	this, but I do see SYSENTER and SYSCALL in a disassembly. These both appear to be two byte 
	instructions but I am not totally sure how they work. ANY HELP WOULD BE COOL.

Thanks:
	Greg Hoglund for starting this madness. I used some code from nt-rootkit-0.44.
	Joe for answering my questions or for making me learn the hard way.
