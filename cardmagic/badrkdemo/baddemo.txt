
A simple .exe that demonstrate bad behaviors of a rootkit.
Its driver simply hides some elements from modern detectors and autostarts when operating system starts.
It ouputs debug information in every 25 seconds.(can be viewed through DbgView or DriverMoniter).

Intro:
the initial thought of this is from vxk's friend atm's work, 
he has written one with a similar implementation(I mentioned on my blog of rootkit.com).
I asked him for a copy,but failed...so make it myself
but this demo is quite incomplete,
because I don't have time to continue working on it.
It can be further implemented if you are interested.
the detail implementaion of this simple demo can also be requested . 

 
Environment:
Windows XP sp2.
I only design and test it under winXP sp2.other OS may get a crush.

How to stop the demo:
to remove it,you should use registry part of DarkSpy anti-rootkit 1.0.5. 
(1).Select HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM,then click "Online Analyze".
(2).select ControlSetXXX\services\#BadRKDemo# in the pop up dialog's tree control.
here the value of "XXX" will display on the registry page of DarkSpy Mainframe.
(3).change the value "start" to 3 
(4).normally restart your computer. 

Warning :
before running it,make sure you have the ablity to stop it(understand the above well),
and don't run it on your important machine.

Use it at your own risk.
